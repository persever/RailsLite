# RailsLite

## Description

A simple recreation of Rails, written in phases. Students at App Academy write
this to intimately familiarize ourselves with the framework.

RailsLite enables an app's developer to create controllers, render ERB
templates, store session cookies, and access parsed params from the router,
query string, and request body. The framework also instantiates an app with a
router, which will properly match routes and invoke the requested action.
